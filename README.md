A crossword puzzle generation library for ruby

This library is a simple crossword generator. It is still in its infancy. I have done most of the work for a basic branch and bound algorithm to generate good, compact crossword puzzles. Contributions are welcome. Fork it and pull request!

Plans for future development include finishing the algorithm, adding tests, and converting it to a gem.
